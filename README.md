# Simon-Memory-Game
The project combines aspects of both hardware and software engineering. The primary objective of this project is to design and implement a functional electronic replica of the Simon game along with some new features and different implementation.

The game consists of a console with four colored buttons, each associated with a unique tone. The game's objective is to replicate a sequence of button presses and corresponding tones that the console generates. The sequence starts with one button press and tone, and with each successful replication, the sequence becomes longer. Players must remember and repeat the sequence accurately to progress to the next level. The game tests and improves memory and pattern recognition skills, making it both entertaining and challenging. Making an incorrect button press or sequence repetition usually ends the game.
